**Pre-Assignments**

1. What is a calibration curve?
2. If the concentration is expressed in mol.m -3 and path length is expressed in meters, then what will be the units of ε? Relate it tothe units when the concentration is expressed in mol.L <sup>-1</sup> and path length is expressed in cm.
3. Why are the values of ε max are large for C=C-C=C containing molecules than C=O containing molecules?
4. For weakly ionized monoprotic acids, it is safe to use the wavelength corresponding to an isosbestic point for any measurement. Why?
5. Two solutions of two substances are showing the same color intensity, even though concentration of one substance is far below the concentration of the other. Why does it happen so?


**Post-Assignments**

1. What are main peak positions in aqueous 2-nitroaniline solutions? What are the origins of such peak positions?
2. Why are the absorbance values of a given concentration of 2-nitroaniline different for three different peak positions?
3. Out of three peaks, which peak was more intense and why?
4. How will a plot of ε versus wavelength be different from that of absorbance versus wavelength?
5. How are the two plots of εversus wavelength related for two different concentrations of a chromophore?
6. Does a compound with high molar absorptivity have a higher or lower limit of detection than a compound with low molar absorptivity?
